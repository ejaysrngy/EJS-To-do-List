# EJS-To-do-List

A project in the Udemy Web Dev course that I took that focuses on database and using requests to manipulate data from a database/API.
It's a combination of a to-do list and a weather app that I have yet to tweak.

The app is deployed in a inactive Heroku page.

Technologies Used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Mongoose
